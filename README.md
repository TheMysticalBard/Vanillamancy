# Vanillamancy

## Overview

Vanillamancy is a Fabric Minecraft mod that takes vanilla items and uses them in unique, new, magical ways. When it comes to methodology, this mod aims to take every "magic" item in vanilla Minecraft and give them well-defined properties that correlate to their uses in-game, extrapolating further uses from there.
